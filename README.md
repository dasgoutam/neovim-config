# neovim-config

This is my neovim configuration. It is a work in progress and will be updated as I learn more about neovim and vimscript.

## Installation

As I am a MacOS user, the config files are located in `~/.config/nvim/`.

After adding a new Plug, install the plug using :PlugInstall

## Keybindings

Keybindings for the plugins installed with this configuration can be found in the `keybindings.md` file.
